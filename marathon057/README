Algorithm
=========

It seems to be quite simple to reverse this kind of hashing, though there's a
lot of things to be taken into account:

To reverse:

 1. loop through numbers 33-126 (inclusive): **i**. XOR the current hash with **i**, and divide it by 33.
   - If the result is and integer, keep the **i**
     + If the integer is equal to *5381*, we arrived to the end
   - Else discard and move to the next **i**
 2. There will be more than one **i** for kept in this step, so have to loop through through them from step 1, and keep branching out until we get a the *5381*


Things to keep in mind
======================

+ Take into account the string length: 4 <= len <= 20. The lower limit is actually very necessary to avoid multiple same strings
+ Need fast and reliable way to check "is integer?" in Java.
